# AML Anomaly Segmentation Project
Group work for the course of Advanced Machine Learning at @POLITO

The task is to build tiny anomaly segmentation models to segment anomalies that could be deployed in real-time. 
The goal is for the models to be able to fit in small devices, which represents a realistic memory constraint for an edge application using a smart camera with some small onboard processing capacity.

## Goals 
1. Get acquainted with the task of anomaly segmentation and understand
the anomaly segmentation dataset and its complexities.
2. Run initial experiments with a few baseline models for anomaly
segmentation.
3. Analyze the anomaly segmentation results by training a void classifier
on different semantic segmentation architectures.
1. Propose your extensions to reduce anomaly segmentation model size while maintaining anomaly segmentation performance. You are free to propose your ideas and choose what you want to focus on.
